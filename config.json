    "What personal characteristics, experiences, and perspectives motivate you to be a Trip Leader and/or Support Crooling? In your answer, feel free to touch on your own transition to Dartmouth or any other perspectives that will guide your interactions with incoming students from all backgrounds.",
    "First-Year Trips presents moments of challenge for both incoming students and leaders. Tell us about a time you faced a challenge or dealt with discomfort. What did you learn from it and/or what would you do differently in the future?",
    "Talk about a community (not necessarily at Dartmouth) you feel part of. What makes you feel like you belong, and what role do you play there? How have you helped others find community at Dartmouth or elsewhere?",
    "Tell us about a time you acted as a peer leader in any way (need not be formal). What actions did you take, and what effects did they have? How do you plan to approach leading a group of 8-10 incoming students (who are also your peers) with a co-Trip Leader?",
    "Throughout Trips, croolings live and work closely with the rest of their croo, cooperating to support incoming students. Talk about something you accomplished with a group or team. What strengths did you bring to that group or team, and in what ways did you cooperate? How would that inform how you work with the rest of your fellow croolings?",
    "Is there anything else you feel like your application would be incomplete without? Please only use this space to write something you haven't previously mentioned! (Optional)"
